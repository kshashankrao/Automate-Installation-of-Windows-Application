Automation has a long history of inventions. It started as early as 270 BC, where the ball clock was invented. Then came the industrial revolution which gave the steam engine, upon which several machines were built. During this generation hardware was the core and everything of the devices. Come back to 2018, in most of the cases: hardware acts based on the softwareâ€™s output.

The aim of automating tasks is to reduce the time taken to complete it. Machines act as a helping hand to achieve it, be it a hardware or a software.
